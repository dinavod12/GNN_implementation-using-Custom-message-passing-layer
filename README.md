# GNN_implementation-using-Custom-message-passing-layer
A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a deep learning model designed to operate on graph-structured data.Here I implement the Link Prediction using custom message passing layers which include node_feature as well edge_feature. Custom messgae passing layers means specialized component in a neural network or graph-based model that allows for the customized exchange of information between nodes in a graph, enabling the model to learn and represent complex relationships within the data.I include both node feature as well edge feature for link prediction.Which you don't found on internet.
